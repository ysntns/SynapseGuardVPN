## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SynapseGuardVPN.git
   cd SynapseGuardVPN
   ```

2. Configure Android SDK location
   - Copy the example configuration file:
     ```bash
     cp local.properties.example local.properties
     ```
   - Edit `local.properties` and update the `sdk.dir` path to your Android SDK location:
     ```properties
     # Linux/Mac example:
     sdk.dir=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/Android/Sdk

     # Windows example:
     sdk.dir=C\\:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
     ```
   - Or create the file directly:
     ```bash
     echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/Sdk" > local.properties
     ```

3. Open in Android Studio
   - File → Open → Select the project directory

4. Build the project
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. Run on device/emulator
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

## Release signing (do not use `local.properties`)

- Keep **only** your Android SDK path in `local.properties`. Store no keystore credentials there.
- Add release keystore details to `gradle.properties` (not committed) or export them as environment variables when invoking Gradle:
  ```properties
  # gradle.properties (local only)
  releaseStoreFile=/absolute/path/to/release.keystore
  releaseStorePassword=your-store-password
  releaseKeyAlias=your-key-alias
  releaseKeyPassword=your-key-password
  ```
- Alternatively, set environment variables to avoid touching files:
  ```bash
  export RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/release.keystore
  export RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your-store-password
  export RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=your-key-alias
  export RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your-key-password
  ./gradlew assembleRelease
  ```
- CI pipeline expectations:
  - Provide a base64-encoded keystore secret as `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and passwords/alias as `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`, `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`.
  - The workflow decodes the keystore to `.signing/release.keystore` and injects the above values into `gradle.properties` for the build job.

## Development

### Building
```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run instrumented tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
